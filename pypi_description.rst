*sklearndf* is an open source library designed to address a common need with
`scikit-learn <https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn>`__: the outputs of
transformers are numpy arrays, even when the input is a
data frame. However, to inspect a model it is essential to keep track of the
feature names.

To this end, *sklearndf* enhances scikit-learn's estimators as follows:

- **Preserve data frame structure**:
    Return data frames as results of transformations, preserving feature names as the column index.
- **Feature name tracing**:
    Add additional estimator properties to enable tracing a feature name back to its original input feature; this is especially useful for transformers that create new features (e.g., one-hot encode), and for pipelines that include such transformers.
- **Easy use**:
    Simply append DF at the end of your usual scikit-learn class names to get enhanced data frame support!
